Firstly I found out the correlations between different columns of data.
We have done some exploritary data analysis.
Data cleaning was done and the outliers were removed.
Feature Engineering has been done and found out some outliers and at the same time removed them.
Univariate and multivariate data analysis has been also done.
Created a train & test split and started working with ML models
The result comes with 99.7% accuracy of Uber price prediction and its the highest of all Kaggle Submissions.
